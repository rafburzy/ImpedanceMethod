# Impedance Matrix Method for Skin Effect Simulation

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/rafburzy/ImpedanceMethod)

This notebook presents implementation of impedance matrix method to calculate strong skin effect along the single copper bar. The formulas for own an mutual inductances are empirical and for circular conductors.

It is possible to run this notebook in binder and play with the content.
